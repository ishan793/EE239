2.
a) NETWORK BACKUP DATASET
Run pj1_1_NBD.py
->Generates actual labels(y),fitted values(yp) and residuals(y-yp). 
Also includes the plot for residual(y-yp) versus fitted values(yp)

Run pj1_2_NBD.py
-> Used to generate Plot for Fitted(yp) and Actual value(y) scatter plot over time

(c) Neural netwrok regression:
Run file neural_regr.py to get the plots are RMSE values for all the data sets

3.
Run piecewise_workflow.py for piecewise linear regression RMSE

Network Backup Dataset(Polynomial Regression)
Run network_cross_valid.py for 10 Fold Cross Validation results
Run network_fixed.py  for RMSE results on fixed testing and training dataset

4.
BOSTON HOUSING DATASET
Linear Regression model
Run pj2_BHD.py
-> THis includes plot for residual(y-yp) versus fitted values(yp)

Housing Dataset(Polynomial Regression)
Run housing_cross_valid.py for 10 Fold Cross Validation results
Run housing_fixed.py for RMSE results on fixed testing and training dataset

5.Ridge and Lasso

Run p2_a3.py to get plots and rmse values.
